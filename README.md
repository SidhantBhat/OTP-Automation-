# OTP-Automation-
This project is a full-fledged OTP Automation System built with Django and Selenium, designed to handle the automatic submission of one-time passwords (OTPs) at large scale with maximum reliability and human-like behavior.

It is tailored for scenarios where hundreds or thousands of OTP-based phone verifications are required across various platforms. The system incorporates advanced automation strategies, including proxy rotation, CAPTCHA detection and resolution (manual + automatic), and real-time job monitoring through a simple web interface.


‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:
1. High Throughput OTP Processing
Supports batch submission of 1,000+ phone numbers.

Optimized with concurrency (multiprocessing/threading/celery optional).

2. Reliability via Proxy & CAPTCHA Handling
Proxy rotation to prevent IP bans and rate limits.

Supports both:

üß† Automatic CAPTCHA resolution using OCR (for simple ones).

‚úçÔ∏è Manual fallback via AJAX for complex image-based CAPTCHAs.

3. Real-Time Monitoring & Logs
Tracks:

Success & failure rates

CAPTCHA occurrence

Proxy usage history

Status viewable via Django admin or custom dashboard.

4. Simple User Interface
Upload phone number batches via CSV.

Monitor job progress and view logs.

CAPTCHA fallback handled through AJAX + frontend click handler.
